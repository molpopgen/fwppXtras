# "Extras" related to fwdpp development

This repo is a trash can of testing code related to [fwdpp](http://molpopgen.github.io/fwdpp).

It contains test simulations that I can use for profiling, etc.

There will be little/no documentation.

The build system will be rigid and inflexible (a hand-written Makefile).

This only exists for helping me address issues that fwdpp users may raise, to answer questions, provide examples, etc.
